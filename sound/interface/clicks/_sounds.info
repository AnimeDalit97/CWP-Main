# WHAT IS THIS FOLDER?
## If Paradox made it possible to mod interface sounds, which at the present moment we are pretty confident we can not, this folder would be used to store the sounds that would used for the mod. 
### until then, here are a few sounds that we have found that we think would be good for the mod.
#### You can just imagine the sounds playing in your head.

# WHY MOD SOUND?
## In order to better fit the era of the mod, it'd be great to include sounds that are more fitting for the time period. 
### Vanilla Victoria 3 has a lot of sounds that are very archaic, they sound great in the context of the game, but they don't really fit the time period of the mod.

# WHAT CAN I DO?
## Glad you asked! If this feature interests you, ask paradox to make it possible to mod interface sounds, rather than just music, and maybe someday we will be able to use this folder.
