  west_german_unification.1.d: "As the leaders of the United States, France, and Great Britain gathered to discuss the potential re-unification of West Germany, they were acutely aware of the hardships that came with maintaining the military occupation zones. The physical and emotional toll on their troops was immense, and the logistical challenges were formidable.\n\nThey knew that time was of the essence, and that a decisive plan needed to finally be put in place before the situation grew more complex and dangerous.

The annexation was supported by many Austrians, who saw it as  an opportunity to unite with Germany and regain lost territory. However, the annexation  also marked the beginning of a period of oppression, persecution, and violence against political dissidents, and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime.\n\nAfter World War II, Austria, alongside Germany, was militarily occupied by the Allied powers, and after German's long standing question of unification being resolved, World's Greatest Powers now ponder of what to do with Austria..."
